## This repo is meant to be a primer on reinforcement learning, specifically deep Q learning. The target audience is anyone familiar with conventional machine learning topics. In order to demonstrate reinforcement learning in action, I built a DQN (deep Q network) using tensorflow and keras to solve the [CartPole](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v1/) problem from [openai-gym](https://gym.openai.com/).
